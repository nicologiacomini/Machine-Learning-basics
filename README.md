# Machine Learning basics

In this repo I uploaded my first Machine Learning projects. In this projects I applied some techniques used in Machine Learning.

So far there are 2 projects (university homeworks).

## Homework 2
In this homework I applied the RMSE approximation and the Gavish et. al method.
The main goal is to choose get an approximation of the reference station data usign 2 different datasets.

## Homework 3 
In this homework I applied the Linear Regression.
The sensors measure the o3, temperature and the humidity. The goal is to get the data of O3 in the air measured by the reference stations.
