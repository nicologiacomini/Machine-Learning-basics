# Machine Learning basics

In this repo I uploaded my first Machine Learning projects. In this projects I applied some techniques used in Machine Learning.

## Homework 2
In this homework I applied the RMSE approximation and the Gavish et. al method.
The main goal is to choose get an approximation of the reference station data usign 2 different datasets.

## Homework 3 
In this homework I applied the Linear Regression.
The sensors measure the o3, temperature and the humidity. The goal is to get the data of O3 in the air measured by the reference stations.

## Homework 4 
In this homework I used two approaches: FNN (Feedforward Neural Network) and Bayesian multiple linear regression.
The sensors measure the o3, temperature and the humidity. The goal is to get the data of O3 in the air measured by the reference stations.
